Single model approaches

Single model with treatment as feature
========================================

The most intuitive and simple uplift modeling technique. A training set consists of two groups: treatment samples and control samples. There is also a binary treatment flag added as a feature to the training set. After the model is trained, at the scoring time it is going to be applied twice:
with the treatment flag equals `1` and with the treatment flag equals `0`. Subtracting these model's outcomes for each test sample, we will get an estimate of the uplift.

    In sklift this approach corresponds to the  :class:`.SoloModel` class and the **dummy** method.

Treatment interaction
=========================

The single model approach has various modifications. For instance, we can update the number of attributes in the training set by adding
the product of each attribute and the treatment flag:
